**Welcome to my blog!** I'm Saeed, a passionate cybersecurity professional with nearly three years of experience in penetration testing and security consulting. This blog is my space to share insights, tips, and resources related to information security, with a particular focus on cloud security, wireless networks, and web applications.

## My Journey into Cybersecurity

Before diving into cybersecurity, I spent several years in customer service, which gave me a strong foundation in problem-solving and understanding user behavior. My curiosity and desire to work in a more technical, impactful field led me to pursue a career in information security. With hard work and determination, I earned my OSCP certification, which opened the door to penetration testing and security consulting.

## What I Do

Currently, I work as a security consultant, specializing in testing AWS cloud infrastructures, wireless networks, and web applications. I focus on identifying vulnerabilities and helping organizations secure their environments against potential threats.

### Certifications & Skills

I'm **OSCP certified** and continuously expanding my skill set. Some of the areas I work in include:

- Penetration testing (web applications, AWS, wireless networks)
- AWS cloud security assessments
- Web application security
- Network assessments
- Learning game hacking (for fun!)

## What You’ll Find on This Blog

On this blog, I’ll be sharing posts about:

- Tutorials and guides for penetration testing
- Cloud security tips (especially AWS)
- Common web application vulnerabilities and how to find them
- Wireless network security best practices
- Fun side projects like game hacking and how they relate to real-world security concepts

## Outside of Work

When I'm not testing security environments, I love exploring **game hacking** as a hobby. It’s a great way to challenge myself, stay sharp, and explore the gaming world from a security perspective. I also enjoy traveling, riding motorcycles and playing retro video games.

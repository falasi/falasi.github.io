# Why I'm Moving My Blog from Medium to GitHub Pages

After blogging on [Medium](https://saeeds.medium.com/) for some time, I've decided to move my content and future posts to **GitHub Pages**. This shift is part of my ongoing journey in cybersecurity and technology, and I want to share why I made this decision and what you can expect from this new platform.

## Why the Switch?

There are a few key reasons why I chose to switch from Medium to GitHub Pages:

### 1. **Complete Control Over Content**
While Medium offers an easy-to-use platform, GitHub Pages gives me full control over the presentation and structure of my blog. This is especially important as I dive deeper into technical topics and want to customize the way I deliver content. GitHub Pages lets me design everything from scratch using Markdown, HTML, and CSS, which aligns with my technical skills and personal preferences.

### 2. **No Paywalls or Ads**
Medium has started to introduce paywalls for certain posts, which can prevent some readers from accessing content freely. By hosting my blog on GitHub Pages, my posts remain completely free and open to everyone without distractions from ads or subscription prompts. I believe in open access to information, especially in the cybersecurity community.

### 3. **Version Control**
As a cybersecurity professional, I rely heavily on version control systems like Git, and GitHub Pages integrates seamlessly with that. It allows me to track changes to my blog, roll back updates if needed, and work more efficiently by using Git workflows. This makes managing content updates and improvements much easier.

### 4. **Learning and Growth**
Switching to GitHub Pages also offers a new learning experience for me. I've always enjoyed learning new technologies, and building and maintaining a static site will give me an opportunity to improve my web development skills. Plus, it's just fun to learn something new!

## What You Can Expect

From here on out, all of my posts will be hosted on this GitHub Pages site, and I'll continue to focus on topics like:
- Penetration testing and security consulting
- Cloud security, specifically in AWS environments
- Web application security and wireless network testing
- Side projects like game hacking, and more!

For those who have followed me from Medium, thank you for your support! Iâ€™m excited to continue this journey on a platform that allows more creativity and flexibility.

If you have any feedback or suggestions on the new setup, feel free to [email me](mailto:contact@falasi.net) or reach out on [Mastodon - Infosec Exchange](https://infosec.exchange/@falasi). I'm always open to hearing what you'd like to see next.
